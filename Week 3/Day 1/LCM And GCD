LCM And GCD

Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. In each test cases, there are two numbers A and B separated by space.

Output:
For each testcase in a new line, print LCM and GCD separated by space.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 104
1 <= A <= 108
1 <= B <= 108

Example:
Input:
2
5 10
14 8

Output:
10 5
56 2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: LCM and GCD of given numbers 5 and 10 are: 10 and 5.
 


Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if(a == 0) {
        return b;
    }
    return gcd(b%a, a);
}

int main() {
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while(t--) {
	    long int a,b;
	    cin>>a>>b;
	    long int res = gcd(a,b);
	    cout << (long)((a*b)/res) <<" "<<res<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
