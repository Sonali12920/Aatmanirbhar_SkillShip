Largest subarray of 0's and 1's

Given an array of 0s and 1s. Find the length of the largest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s.
Input:
The first line of the input is T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow . Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case is a number N denoting the size of the array and in the next line are N space separated values of A [].
Output:
For each test case output in a new line the max length of the subarray.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxLen() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array as inputs and returns the length of the largest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= A[] <= 1

Example:
Input
2
4
0 1 0 1
5
0 0 1 0 0

Output
4
2



Solution:

int maxLen(int arr[], int N)
{
        map<int,int> m;
        int curr = 0;
        int res = 0;
        int a[N+2];
        for(int i = 0 ; i<N ; i++)
            a[i+1] = arr[i];
        for(int i = 1 ; i<=N ; i++)
        {
            curr += a[i]==0 ?-1:1;
            if(curr==0)
            {
                res = max(res , i);
            }
            else
            {
                if(m[curr])
                    res = max(res , i - m[curr]);
                else
                    m[curr] = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
}
