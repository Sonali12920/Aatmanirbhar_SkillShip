Single Number II

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3


Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
         int res=0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++){
            int num_0=0,num_1=0;
            for(auto j:nums){
                if(j&(1<<i))
                    num_1++;
                else
                    num_0++;
            }
            if(num_0%3==0)
                res|=(1<<i);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
