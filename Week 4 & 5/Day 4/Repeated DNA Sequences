Repeated DNA Sequences

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]



Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
       
        ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        vector<string> v;
        unordered_map<string, int> seen;
        int i = 0;
        while(i+10 <= s.size()) {
            string subseq = s.substr(i, 10); 
            seen[subseq]++; 
            if(seen[subseq]==2) {  
                v.push_back(subseq);
            }
            i++;
        }
        return v;
    }
};
